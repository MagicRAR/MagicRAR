GZIP/BZIP2 archives can compress only a single file at a time. Please try again (you may use TAR to merge multiple files into a single file).
Archive has been tested successfully.
Tip: If you rename the extension of the archive (the part that ends in .EXE) to the type you suspect the archive actually is (.ZIP or .RAR are most common), you can open it directly without using this tool.
