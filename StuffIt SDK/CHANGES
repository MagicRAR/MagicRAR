    Windows executables and shared libraries are compressed to reduce size.
    Linux executables are statically linked and compressed and should run
    on any i386 Linux with kernel version 2.0+ (all distributions since about
    mid-1996). The new registration scheme is based on old-style serial numbers,
    but uses a versioned format and an external key file.

    Smaller SEAs, more inline code.

Build 5.1.0.510 2000/08/01 (status: experimental, urgency: high)

    the engine a multi-library release. C interface calls changed to match
    C++ calls. SEA sizes significantly reduced. Linux build includes statically
    linked executables.
