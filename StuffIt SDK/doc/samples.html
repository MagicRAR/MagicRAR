<h3>Samples</h3>

<p>Sample code that demonstrates simple and detailed use of the StuffIt Engine
SDK features is located in <a href="../src/app/"><b>src/app/</b></a> and
<a href="../src/sample/"><b>src/sample/</b></a>.

<p>The following sample Visual C++ 6.0 projects are provided:

<p><table width=100% bgcolor=#ffffff cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1 border=0>

<tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0>
<td valign=top><a href="../src/app/stuff/"><b>stuff</b></a></td>

<td>A console application that creates multiple archive formats and provides
event callback trace and multiple options. Written in C++ and uses the C++
StuffIt Engine interface. Shares option classes with <b>unstuff</b>;
see the <a href="../src/app/option/">src/app/option/</a>.

StuffIt Engine interface. Shares option classes with <b>unstuff</b>;

options. Written in C++ and uses the C++ StuffIt Engine interface.</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0>
<td valign=top><a href="../src/sample/expand2/"><b>expand2</b></a></td>

<td>A simple console application that expands multiple archive formats. Same
functionality as <b>expand1</b>. No options. Written in C and uses the C StuffIt
Engine interface. (Note that we do not recommend using the C interface; the C++
interface should be favored in new applications using the SDK.)</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0>
<td valign=top><a href="../src/sample/stuff1/"><b>stuff1</b></a></td>

<td>A console application that creates StuffIt 5 archives. No options. Written
in C++ and uses the C++ StuffIt Engine interface.</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0>
<td valign=top><a href="../src/sample/stuff2/"><b>stuff2</b></a></td>

<td>A console application that creates StuffIt 5 archives. Same functionality
as <b>stuff1</b>. No options. Written in C and uses the C StuffIt Engine
interface.  (Note that we do not recommend using the C interface; the C++
interface should be favored in new applications using the SDK.)</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0>
<td valign=top><a href="../src/sample/zip/"><b>zip</b></a></td>

<td>A console application that creates Zip archives. Option to adjust
compression level. Uses one event callback. Written in C++ and uses the C++
StuffIt Engine interface.</td></tr>

<p>The Visual C++ 6.0 project files are located in <a href="../win32/">win32/</a>.
They link with the static SDK library, <b>stuffit5.engine.lib</b>, or the SDK export
library, <b>stuffit5.engine-5.1.lib</b>, located in <a href="../win32/bin/">win32/bin/</a>.
The export library contains exported symbols of the dynamic SDK library,
<b>stuffit5.engine-5.1.dll</b>, also located in <a href="../win32/bin/">win32/bin/</a>.

<p>The <b>samples.dsw</b> workspace file contains all sample projects.

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol><li>The following build configurations are defined in all sample projects:

<ul><li>Win32 Release,
<li>Win32 Debug,
<li>Win32 Release Static, and
<li>Win32 Debug Static.</ul>

All build configurations use the same multithreaded dynamic (DLL) C and C++
runtime (see <b>Project/Settings...</b> menu, <b>C/C++</b> tab, <b>Code Generation</b>
category, <b>Use run-time library</b> setting).

<li>Projects are configured to generate executable files in <b>win32/bin/</b> and <b>win32/D/</b>,
for release and debug configurations dynamically linked with the StuffIt Engine; and
<b>win32/binS/</b> and <b>win32/binDS/</b>, for configurations statically linked with the StuffIt
Engine. Intermediate files are placed in further <i>sub</i>directories of each of these four
directories. The names of the subdirectories correspond to the names of the sample projects; for
example, internediate files of the dynamically linked release configuration of the <b>expand1</b>
project are going to be in <b>win32/bin/expand1</b>.

<li>All projects link with either the static StuffIt Engine library or with the
dynamic library's export library; both of which are located in <a
href="../win32/bin/">win32/bin/</a>.

<li>Statically linked projects need a link option adjustment for debug builds. In the
<b>Project/Settings...</b> menu, <b>Link</b> tab, <b>Input</b> category, <b>Ignore libraries</b>
must list <b>libcmt.lib</b> to avoid collisions between release and debug versions of runtime
functions that would otherwise occur because a release build of a library is being linked with a
debug build of an executable.

<li>All linked projects must be linked with the multithreaded dynamic (DLL) runtime library. These
projects are already configured appropriately: in the <b>Project/Settings...</b> menu, <b>C/C++</b>
tab, <b>Code Generation</b> category, <b>Use run-time library</b> must be <b>Multithreaded</b> in
release builds and <b>Debug Multithreaded</b> in debug builds. Visual C++ default code generation is
single-threaded, so you may have to do the equivalent adjustment in new projects that link with the
static SDK library.

<li>Note that all headers located in <a href="../src/">src/</a> and its subdirectories are included
with their path names relative to <b>src/</b>; for example,

<code><pre>
    #include "stuffit5/event/ReaderEventHandler.h"
</pre></code>

The include path in the <b>Project/Settings...</b> menu, <b>C/C++</b> tab, <b>Preprocessor</b>
category, <b>Additional include directories</b> contains only <b>../src</b>.
