<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The StuffIt Engine allows developers to incorporate compression and
decompression of files in several compressed and encoded formats into any
file-based application. Use of the engine requires only minimal knowledge of the
underlying formats. Compressors and decompressors can be implemented in a few
lines of code. The additional advantage of using the StuffIt Engine is that all
formats it supports use the same interface, so once support of a single format
is implemented, it takes a trivial amount of work to add other formats.

<p>The engine performs three functions: determining file types based on their
contents (classifying); creating archives from original files (encoding,
stuffing), and re-creating original files from archives (decoding, expanding).
All operations are handled by calls to the engine functions described in this
guide.

<p>The engine's design is based on two conflicting goals: ease of use and great
control over details of decoding and encoding processes. Using the StuffIt
Engine, it is easy to write applications that perform tasks similar to what many
archivers do, yet require very little code. For more runtime control, the engine
has an option of using event callback functions. Normally, however, all or most
event callbacks are left unused, leaving you with a very simple interface to the
engine.

<h4>Contents of this SDK</h4>

<p>This version of the StuffIt Engine includes static and dynamic libraries
for Win32, Linux, and Solaris platforms. There is one SDK archive per platform.

<h4>Preliminaries</h4>

<h5>Terminology</h5>

<p>The following terms are used in this document.

<p><i>Compression</i> is a process of transforming data into a more compact
representation. <i>Decompression</i> is a process of restoring the original
data given its compressed representation. <i>Encryption</i> is a data
transformation applied with the purpose of concealing data.
<i>Decryption</i> is a process of recovering the original data from its
encrypted representation.

<p>An <i>archive</i> is a file containg one or more files, normally in
compressed form. Examples of archives are Zip (.zip), gzip (.gz), tar
(.tar), and StuffIt (.sit, .sea) files. An <i>encoded file</i> is one or
more files that have been transformed into a different form for storage
or transmission. Examples of encoded files are uuencoded files, BinHex
(.hqx) files, and MacBinary (.bin) files. Most encoded formats (such as
BinHex, MacBinary, and uuencode) and some compressed formats (such as
gzip) are only capable of storing single files.

<p><i>Encoding</i> and <i>writing</i> are used to describe the process of
creating archives or encoded files. Compression and encryption are two
particular cases of encoding and may or may not be a part of this
process. <i>Decoding</i> and <i>reading</i> are used to describe the process
of reading archives or encoded files and re-creating the original files
contained in them. Decompression and decryption may be part of this
process.

<h5>Archive and File Properties</h5>

<p>The following is a general description of some properties of archives
and files that are important for the engine.

<p>Archives contain <i>items</i> (such as <i>files</i> and <i>folders</i>), that
are hierarchically arranged in a <i>tree structure</i> (similar to a
filesystem tree). Archives may contain one or more items at the <i>root
level</i>. File items have bodies (the file body, or the file's forks in
case of Macintosh files) and attributes (such as size or sizes,
timestamps or filesystem attributes). Folder items do not have bodies,
but do have attributes.

<p>In most cases archive structure reflects the structure of the part of
a filesystem that was put into the archive. This structure is saved as
the archive is created and items put into it, and restored as the
archive is decoded, and original items are recreated.

<p>Both creation (encoding) of an archive and decoding of the files
contained in it results in new filesystem objects being created. The
location where these objects are created is the <i>destination</i> of the
reader or writer operation. The destination is often referred to as a
<i>destination folder</i>; if the destination is a volume, its root folder
is the destination folder.

<h4>Engine Components</h4>

<p>The StuffIt Engine is delivered as both static and dynamic-link
libraries, with interfaces for C and C++ languages. The base interface
is a set of C types, functions, and event callback prototypes. The C
language was chosen for the base interface because of its greater
portability at the object code level. The C++ interface can be extended
and customized by inheritance and virtual function mechanisms.

<p>The C and C++ interfaces can be used with both static and
dynamic-link libraries.
