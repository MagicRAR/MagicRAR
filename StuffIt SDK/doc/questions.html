<h3>Questions and answers</h3>

<p>This document answers some simple questions about using the StuffIt Engine
SDK. It may also be useful as a quick introduction before you look at the samples
provided in the SDK.

<b>What is the simplest way to expand a StuffIt archive, for example,
<b>archive.sit</b>?</b>

<dd>The shortest possible C++ program that expands <b>archive.sit</b> is:

<code><pre>
    #include "stuffit5/Reader.h"

    int main(void) {
        stuffit5::Reader reader;
        reader.open("archive.sit");
        reader.decode();
        reader.close();
        return 0;
    }
</pre></code>

<p>Here's what this program does:

<ul><li><code>#include "stuffit5/Reader.h"</code> defines the reader class.
This class provides member functions that classify (determine format), scan
(verify) and decode (expand) archives.

<li><code>reader.open("archive.sit");</code> opens the archive.

<li><code>reader.decode();</code> decodes (expands) the archive.

<li><code>reader.close();</code> closes the archive.

</ul>

<p>That's all there is to it, as long as you don't care about the details.

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>How are errors handled?</b>

<dd>In the previous example, here's what can be done to handle potential
errors in a simple way:

<code><pre>
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include "stuffit5/Reader.h"
    #include "un/exception.h"

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        try {
            stuffit5::Reader reader;
            reader.open(argv[1]);
            reader.decode();
            reader.close();
        }
        catch (un::exception& e) {
            std::cout << e.type() << " exception: " << e.reason() << "." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }
        catch (...) {
            std::cout << "Oops, something's gone seriously wrong!" << std::endl;
            return 2;
        }
        return 0;
    }
</pre></code>

<p>What does this do?

<ul><li>First, this program considers its first command-line argument to be the
name of the archive to expand. This way, you can try to give it a non-existent
file to see how it handles it.

<li><code>#include "un/exception.h"</code> defines the base class of all
exceptions thrown by the StuffIt Engine. The <code>catch (un::exception&
e)</code> block reports the type of the exception (<code>e.type()</code>) and
prints its message (<code>e.reason()</code>).

<li><code>catch (...)</code> "eats" all other exceptions and says "Oops!"

<li><code>return 0;</code>, <code>return 1;</code> and <code>return 2;</code>
are a common courtesy to your operating system.

</ul>

<p>For example, if this program is called <b>expand</b> and you try to <b>expand
sit.happens</b> and there is no file named <b>sit.happens</b>, the program will
print

<pre>
    <i>Input exception: io::File::open() cannot open sit.happens.</i>
</pre>

<p>If you try <b>expand bad.zip</b> and <b>bad.zip</b> is a damaged Zip archive,
it will come up with:

<pre>
    <i>Bad data exception: CRC mismatch in zip reader; data is invalid.</i>
</pre>

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Is it possible to separate error types?</b>

<dd>Yes. In the previous case of a bad Zip archive, the exception that
was caught was actually a <code>stuffit5::exception::BadData</code>. If
you care to handle it separately, for example, and provide your own
error message, it can be done as follows:

<p>Add another header file:

<code><pre>
    #include "stuffit5/exception/BadData.h"
</pre></code>

<p>Then add the following <code>catch</code> block <i>before</i> the
<code>catch (un::exception& e)</code> block (because
<code>stuffit5::exception::BadData</code> is a subclass of
<code>un::exception</code>, and we always want to catch more
specific exceptions before the more generic ones):

<code><pre>
    catch (stuffit5::exception::BadData& e) {
        std::cout << argv[1] << " archive is fubar!" << std::endl;
    }
</pre></code>

<p>To learn more about the engine's exception hierarchy, look at the class hierarchy
or at the class diagrams in the <b>Reference</b> section.

<p>The <b>Samples</b> section also contains two samples, <b>stuff</b> and
<b>unstuff</b>, that have detailed error reporting.

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>What is the simplest way to compress a file, let's say, <b>this.file</b>, and
create a StuffIt archive?</b>

<dd><p>The shortest possible C++ program that will put <b>this.file</b> into a
new StuffIt archive is:

<code><pre>
    #include "stuffit5/Writer.h"

    int main(void) {
        stuffit5::Writer writer;
        std::list&lt;std::string> toStuff;
        toStuff.push_back("this.file");
        writer.create(toStuff);
        return 0;
    }
</pre></code>

<p>Here's what this program does:

<ul><li><code>#include "stuffit5/Writer.h"</code> defines the writer class.
This class provides a member function that creates a new archive from one or
more files or folders.

<li><code>std::list&lt;std::string> toStuff;</code> and
<code>toStuff.push_back("this.file");</code> create a list of strings (with one
string in it, the name of our only file).

<li><code>writer.create(toStuff);</code> creates the archive.

</ul>

<p>Now we have a StuffIt archive, <b>this.file.sit</b>.

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>In the previous example, how can I create a Zip archive named
<b>something-else.zip</b> instead?</b>

<dd>Add the following two lines after <code>stuffit5::Writer writer;</code>:

<code><pre>
    writer.archiveInfo().format(stuffit5::Format::zip);
    writer.archiveInfo().name("something-else.zip");
</pre></code>

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>How do I put multiple files and folders into an archive?</b>

<dd>Build an <code>std::list</code> of <code>std::string</code>s that are the
names or path names of all items you want at the root level of the archive, then
call <code>create()</code>.

<p>When you create an archive from a folder, all subfolders of that folder with
their contents will be added to the archive, recursively.

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>How do I encode a file into BinHex format?</b>

<dd>Add, after <code>stuffit5::Writer writer;</code>:

<code><pre>
    writer.archiveInfo().format(stuffit5::Format::hqx);
</pre></code>

<p>Archive formats and encoded file formats are almost equal; they are all created
with the same writers. Only the <code>format</code> archive property is different.

<p>There are also limitations inherent in the archive and encoded formats
themselves. In this case, BinHex format cannot store folders in a BinHex file.

<b>What are the development environment settings needed in Visual C++ 6.0
to compile and run the short code samples given in this document?</b>

<dd>Here's how you can try them:

<ul><li>Create a new project (<b>File/New...</b> menu, <b>Project</b> tab) of
type <b>Win32 Console Application</b> with a name of your choice in a directory
of your choice.

<li>Change the following settings under the <b>Project/Settings...</b> menu:

<ul><li>In the <b>C/C++</b> tab, <b>Code Generation</b> category, <b>Use
run-time library</b>, select <b>Debug Multithreaded DLL</b> for the
<b>Win32 Debug</b> build configuration, and <b>Multithreaded DLL</b> for
the <b>Win32 Release</b> build configuration.

<li>In the <b>C/C++</b> tab, <b>Preprocessor</b> category, add the <b>src/</b>
directory of the StuffIt Engine SDK to the <b>Additional include directories</b> field.
This allows directives like <code>#include "stuffit5/Reader.h"</code> and
<code>#include "un/exception.h"</code> to find the header files.</ul>

<li>Create a <b>.cpp</b> source file containg a code example from this document
and add it to the project (<b>Project/Add To Project/Files</b> menu).

<li>Add the appropriate StuffIt Engine library to the project:
Use the static library, <b>win32/bin/stuffit5.engine.lib</b>, to
link the StuffIt Engine statically, or the export library,
<b>win32/bin/stuffit5.engine-5.1.lib</b>, to link dynamically. If you
link dynamically, you will need to have <b>win32/bin/stuffit5.engine-5.1.dll</b>,
and two runtime libraries, <b>MSVCRT.DLL</b> and <b>MSVCP60.DLL</b> in
the directory where the executable is going to be, or somewhere on the
system path, as defined by the <b>PATH</b> environment variable.

<li>And last: if you choose to link the StuffIt Engine statically, under the
<b>Project/Settings...</b> menu, <b>Link</b> tab, <b>Input</b> category,
<b>Ignore libraries</b> list <b>libcmt.lib</b> (when code for the
<b>Multithreaded</b> runtime) or <b>msvcrt.lib</b> (when generating code for the
<b>Multithreaded DLL</b> runtime). This is needed to avoid collisions between
release and debug versions of runtime functions that would otherwise occur
because a release build of a static library is being linked with a debug build
of an executable. If you forget to do this, a warning will appear at link time:

<pre>
    LINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib "LIBCMT" conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library
</pre>

or

<pre>
    LINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib "MSVCRT" conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library
</pre>

</ul>

<p>If this sounds like more trouble that it's worth, you may choose to proceed
to the real samples described in the <b>Samples</b> section. Their preconfigured
Visual C++ projects will compile and link immediately. However, keep in mind
that these details will become important when you try to integrate the StuffIt
Engine into other projects.

<dt><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Why is a shared-runtime ("Multithreaded DLL") build required when
linking with the StuffIt Engine?</b>

<dd>The dynamically linked, shared runtime is preferred because it
avoids subtle memory allocation issues due to the fact that statically
linked runtimes maintain their own heaps, one per executable module.
Things work okay with the statically linked runtimes until you need to
allocate memory in one module and release in another. This is not as
hard to encounter as it may sound; for example, using
<code>std::string</code> as it is implemented in Visual C++ (with
reference counting to share string representation and save memory) leads
to these problems. However, on the negative side, the shared C++
runtime, <b>MSVCP60.DLL</b>, depends on the shared C runtime,
<b>MSVCRT.DLL</b> which you must install as a private copy - or else
face the difficulties due to the fact that its name does not include the
compiler version, and the common copy is certain to be in use by several
running modules.
