<blockquote>
Folder information.

<p>Each <code>stuffit5::Reader</code> and <code>stuffit5::Writer</code> has one
instance of this class that stores information about each folder being read or written.

<p>This class allows access to folder <i>properties</i> through accessor and mutator
functions. Some of the properties are optional.

<p>Folder properties are available during archive decoding and creation. They are
available at the time of <code>FolderInfo</code>, <code>FolderDecodeBegin</code> and
<code>FolderEncodeBegin</code> event callbacks.

<DD>Current <i>absolute</i> path name of the folder being processed.

<p><b>In a reader:</b> The accessor returns (during scan and decoding
phases) the absolute path name of the output folder being scanned or
decoded by the reader, at the time of the call. Undefined when no
archive scanning or decoding is taking place.

<p>The mutator assigns the path name of the folder that is being decoded
by the reader; it sets the final path name of the folder. The path name
may be absolute or relative to the current directory. This can be used
to control the name of each output folder. It has effect only during the
decoding phase and only if it used before the output folder is created.
For example, it can be used in the <code>FolderDecodeBegin</code> event
callback to rename output folders, or to redirect them to a location
different from the destination folder the reader has been assigned.

<p><b>In a writer:</b> The accessor returns, during the archive creation
phase, the path name of the input folder being added to the archive by
the writer. Undefined when no archive creation is taking place.

<p>The mutator assigns the new path name of the folder that is being
added to the archive by the writer. The path name may be absolute or
relative. If the input folder is not open yet, the last chance to change
its name or location (i.e., replace the "proposed" folder and add a
different file) is during the <code>FolderEncodeBegin</code> event
callback.

<DD>Current Unicode <i>folder</i> name (not the <i>path</i> name) of the
folder being processed.

<p><b>In a reader:</b> The accessor returns (during the scan and the
decoding phases) the Unicode name of the output folder being scanned or
decoded by the reader, at the time of the call. Undefined when no
archive scanning or decoding is taking place. Unicode folder names are
available only in StuffIt5 archives that store Unicode names.

<p>The mutator assigns the name of the output folder. It has effect only
during the decoding phase and only if it used before the output folder is
open. For example, it can be used in the <code>FolderDecodeBegin</code>
event callback to rename output folders, or to redirect them to a location
different from the destination folder the reader has been assigned.

<p><b>In a writer:</b> The mutator assigns the Unicode folder name. The
name is not a complete path name, but just the folder name to be stored in
the archive. The name can be changed during the
<code>FolderEncodeBegin</code> event callback.

<p>The complete path name is available through the <code>name()</code>
property, and contains the UTF8-encoded folder name from the archive; the
folder name part may be replaced (through the <code>name</code> mutator by
a name acceptable to the target system and based on the Unicode folder
name.
