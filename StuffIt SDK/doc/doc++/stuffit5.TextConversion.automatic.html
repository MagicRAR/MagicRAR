<h4>Documentation</h4>
<blockquote>
Text files are converted. Text conversion is applied to output files that are
created by engine readers during decompression or decoding and are <i>known
to contain text</i>. End-of-lines are changed according to a
<code>stuffit5::TextType</code>.

<p>Files that are <i>known to contain text</i> are defined as follows: either
the format being decompressed or decoded by the reader contains an indication or
flag that a file is a text file, or a file is a Macintosh file that has
Macintosh file type of <code>"TEXT"</code> as its attribute stored in the
archive.
