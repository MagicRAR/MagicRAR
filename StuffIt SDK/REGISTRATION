StuffIt Engine SDK(tm) registration

You will be provided a registration number and/or a key file.

If you have a key file and don't mind an extra file hanging around, keep it
together (in the same directory) with the StuffIt Engine shared library or
any application that is statically linked with the StuffIt Engine.

If you do not have a key file or wish to use your registration number to
permanently patch the static library or the shared library, follow these
instructions (we will assume that your registration number is
LCPC-999-999999):

To apply the registration number to the static library, stuffit5.engineS.lib,
execute the following command in the win32/binS/ directory:
    register stuffit5.engineS.lib LCPC-999-999999

In Linux and Solaris, to register libstuffit5.engine.a, execute the following in
linix/lib/:
    register libstuffit5.engine.a LCPC-999-999999

To apply the registration number to the shared library, stuffit5.engine-5.1.dll
or stuffit5.engineS-5.1.dll, execute the following command in the win32/bin/
or win32/binS directory, respectively:
    register stuffit5.engine-5.1.dll LCPC-999-999999
    or
    register stuffit5.engineS-5.1.dll LCPC-999-999999

In Linux and Solaris, to register libstuffit5.engine-5.1.so, execute the following in
linix/lib/:
    register libstuffit5.engine-5.1.so LCPC-999-999999

To apply the registration number to a program.exe executable linked with the
static engine library, execute the following command:
    register program.exe LCPC-999-999999

In Linux and Solaris, to register a 'program' executable linked with the static
engine library, execute the following command:
    register program LCPC-999-999999

In Linux and Solaris, to register the stuff executable, execute the following
commands:
    [../util/]upx -d stuff (if the executable is compressed)
    register stuff LCPC-999-999999
    [../util/]upx stuff (to recompress the executable if desired)

upx is an executable compression utility that is needed to decompress and
recompress the stuff executable. (If you are building stuff yourself as a
sample, it will be uncompressed.)
